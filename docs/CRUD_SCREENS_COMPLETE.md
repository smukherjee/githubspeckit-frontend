# CRUD Screens Implementation

## Summary

Implemented comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) screens for all resources, matching the functionality of the Tenants screen. Also fixed Audit Events display issues with nested data structures.

## Changes Made

### 1. Feature Flags CRUD (`src/resources/featureFlags/index.tsx`)

**Enhancements:**
- ✅ Added `rowClick="edit"` to Datagrid for easy editing
- ✅ Added bulk action buttons (Enable, Disable, Delete)
- ✅ Added `created_at` and `updated_at` columns to list view
- ✅ Enhanced Edit form to show timestamps
- ✅ Updated Show view to display all fields including tenant_id

**Features:**
- **List View**: Key, State, Variant, Created, Updated
- **Create**: Key (required), State (enabled/disabled), Variant (optional)
- **Edit**: Same as create + read-only timestamps
- **Show**: All fields including flag_id, tenant_id, timestamps
- **Bulk Actions**: Enable all, Disable all, Delete selected

### 2. Policies CRUD (`src/resources/policies/index.tsx`)

**Enhancements:**
- ✅ Added `rowClick="edit"` to Datagrid
- ✅ Added bulk delete button
- ✅ Added `created_at` column to list view
- ✅ Reordered fields for better UX (Resource Type, Effect, Version, Condition)
- ✅ Changed version input from TextInput to NumberInput
- ✅ Enhanced Edit form with timestamps and created_by
- ✅ Updated Show view with proper date formatting

**Features:**
- **List View**: Resource Type, Effect, Version, Condition, Created
- **Create**: Resource Type, Effect, Version, Condition Expression
- **Edit**: Same as create + read-only policy_id, created_by, timestamps
- **Show**: All fields with proper formatting
- **Bulk Actions**: Delete selected

### 3. Users CRUD (`src/resources/users/UserList.tsx`)

**Enhancements:**
- ✅ Added `rowClick="edit"` to Datagrid for easy editing
- ✅ Added bulk delete button
- ✅ Added `updated_at` column to list view
- ✅ Maintained responsive design (SimpleList for mobile)

**Features:**
- **List View**: Email, Roles, Status, Created, Updated
- **Filters**: Email search, Status, Roles
- **Bulk Actions**: Enable, Disable, Delete
- **Responsive**: SimpleList on mobile, Datagrid on desktop

### 4. Audit Events Display Fix (`src/resources/auditEvents/index.tsx`)

**Problem:**
Backend returns nested `target` object structure:
```json
{
  "target": {
    "type": "user",
    "id": "system",
    "tenant_id": "..."
  }
}
```

But frontend was expecting flat fields: `actor_id`, `resource_type`, `resource_id`.

**Solution:**
- ✅ Removed bulk action buttons (audit events are immutable)
- ✅ Added `bulkActionButtons={false}` to disable checkboxes
- ✅ Updated filters to use correct field names (actor_user_id, category)
- ✅ Used `FunctionField` to extract data from nested `target` object
- ✅ Display Target Type, Target ID, Target Tenant ID from `target` object
- ✅ Format metadata as pretty-printed JSON in Show view
- ✅ Added category badge in Show view

**Features:**
- **List View**: Timestamp, Action, Category, Actor User ID, Target Type, Target ID
- **Show View**: All fields with proper nested data extraction
- **Filters**: Actor User ID, Action, Category, Date range
- **No Delete**: Audit events are immutable (read-only)

## What to Test in Browser

### Feature Flags (http://localhost:5173/#/feature-flags)
1. **List**: Should show all flags with state and variant
2. **Create**: Create new flag with key, state, variant
3. **Edit**: Edit existing flag, see timestamps
4. **Delete**: Select multiple flags and delete
5. **Bulk Enable/Disable**: Select flags and enable/disable

### Policies (http://localhost:5173/#/policies)
1. **List**: Should show all policies with resource type and effect
2. **Create**: Create new policy with resource type, effect, condition
3. **Edit**: Edit existing policy, see policy_id and timestamps
4. **Delete**: Select multiple policies and delete

### Users (http://localhost:5173/#/users)
1. **List**: Should show all users with email, roles, status
2. **Edit**: Click on row to edit user
3. **Delete**: Select multiple users and delete
4. **Bulk Actions**: Enable/disable multiple users

### Audit Events (http://localhost:5173/#/audit-events)
1. **List**: Should show events with correct Target Type and Target ID (not blank)
2. **Show**: Click on event to see detailed view with nested target data
3. **No Delete**: No checkboxes or delete buttons (read-only)
4. **Export**: CSV export button should work

## Backend Data Structure Notes

**Audit Events** response from `/api/v1/audit/events`:
```json
{
  "event_id": "...",
  "action": "token.revoke",
  "category": "token",
  "actor_user_id": "...",
  "target": {
    "type": "system",
    "id": "system",
    "tenant_id": "..."
  },
  "metadata": {
    "jti": "...",
    "user_id": "...",
    "revoked_at": "..."
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-17T05:18:28.935521+00:00"
}
```

The frontend now correctly extracts:
- `target.type` → displayed as "Target Type"
- `target.id` → displayed as "Target ID"
- `target.tenant_id` → displayed as "Target Tenant ID"
